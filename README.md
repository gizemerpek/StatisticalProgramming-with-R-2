# StatisticalProgramming-with-R-2

IdNo: Id numbers of individuals in the sample
Group: categorical variable with 4 levels (Group1, Group2, Group3 and Group4)
Gender: categorical variable with 2 levels (Male and Female)
Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Var6, Var7 and Var8: continuous variables. 

Questions
In order to answer each question, please WRITE YOUR OWN FUNCTION USING R-PROJECT, 
hand in the r functions and outputs and be aware of missing observations in “DatasetNA.txt”.
1. Calculate
• Number of observations, 
• Minimum, 
• Maximum, 
• Range, 
• Sum, 
• Mean, 
• Median, 
• Sum of squares, 
• Variance, 
• Standard deviation
for Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Var6, Var7 and Var8 continuous variables and calculate 
• Cross-products, 
• Covariance 
• Correlations
between variables by writing your own function in R.
2. Calculate
• Number of observations, 
• Minimum, 
• Maximum, 
• Range, 
• Sum, 
• Mean,• Median, 
• Sum of squares, 
• Variance, 
• Standard deviation
for Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Var6, Var7 and Var8 continuous variables by only factor of 
group, only factor of gender and group by gender factor combination and calculate 
• Cross-products, 
• Covariance 
• Correlations
between variables by only factor of group, only factor of gender and group by gender factor 
combination by writing your own function in R.
3. Please write your own function to draw scatterplot between two variables and to draw 
scatterplot-matrix among variables in a data frame
4. Please write your own function to scale a variable or variables in a data frame
